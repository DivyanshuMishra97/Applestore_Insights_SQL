## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Missing Values in Key Fields
The dataset was checked for missing values in essential fields, such as `track_name`, `user_rating`, and `prime_genre`. Additionally, app descriptions were analyzed for missing values.

- **Result**: No missing values were found in the `AppleStore` table or in the `app_desc` field of the `appleStore_description_combined` table.

## Objectives

1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset structure and identify key insights.
2. Answer business questions like:
   - Do paid apps have higher ratings than free apps?
   - Which genres have the lowest and highest ratings?
   - Does the number of languages supported correlate with higher ratings?
   - Does the length of the app description affect user ratings?
3. Provide actionable recommendations for app developers based on findings.

## SQL Queries and Insights

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**

- **Number of Unique Apps**:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)) AS uniqueAppIDs
  FROM AppleStore;

---

### Number of Apps Per Genre
The distribution of apps across genres was analyzed.  
- **Result**: The **Games** genre has the highest number of apps, followed by **Entertainment** and **Education**.

---

### Paid vs Free Apps: Ratings Comparison
- **Insight**: Paid apps generally have higher average ratings compared to free apps.

---

## Final Recommendations
1. **Paid Apps Perform Better**: Developers should consider offering premium features to justify a paid app model.
2. **Language Support Matters**: Supporting **10‚Äì30 languages** can significantly enhance user ratings and reach.
3. **Opportunity in Low-Rated Genres**: Focus on **Finance** and **Book** apps to address gaps in user satisfaction.
4. **Leverage Long Descriptions**: Create detailed and engaging app descriptions to improve user ratings.
5. **Aim for Ratings Above 3.5**: Ensure that a new app meets the average threshold for success.
6. **Games and Entertainment Are Saturated**: While these genres are competitive, they offer a huge user base for innovative apps.
